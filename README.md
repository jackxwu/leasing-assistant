# Leasing Assistant

A full-stack chat application for prospective renters with intelligent response handling and actionable next steps.

## Requirements Summary

This is implemention of a **Mini Leasing Assistant API** that processes prospective renter inquiries and provides intelligent responses.

### Core Scenario
- Prospective renter sends free-text message (email/SMS)
- Microservice must:
  - Decide which domain tool(s) to call for information
  - Craft human-ready reply
  - Return next-action for front-end execution

### Required Components
1. **LLM-Agent Logic**: Lightweight agent using LLM (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini) to orchestrate domain tools
2. **Domain Tools**: Three required tools for property information
3. **React Frontend**: TypeScript chat workspace with message list and input
4. **Backend API**: FastAPI endpoints for chat message processing
5. **Data Layer**: Mock inventory with observability logging

### Domain Tools Required
- `check_availability(community_id, bedrooms)` → Unit availability information
- `check_pet_policy(community_id, pet_type)` → Pet policy and fees
- `get_pricing(community_id, unit_id, move_in_date)` → Rent and specials

### Action System
- `propose_tour`: System suggests specific tour slot
- `ask_clarification`: Question needs more details  
- `handoff_human`: Cannot fulfill automatically

## Overview

This application processes free-text messages (email or SMS) from prospective renters and provides intelligent responses with actionable next steps. The system decides which tools to call, crafts human-ready replies, and returns actions that the front-end can execute.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React TypeScript chat interface with message list, input bar, and dynamic action buttons
- **Backend**: FastAPI Python service with intelligent agent logic for processing renter inquiries
- **Communication**: REST API with CORS-enabled endpoints

## Key Features

- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Responsive chat workspace with message history
- **Intelligent Response System**: Context-aware responses based on inquiry type
- **Action-based UI**: Dynamic buttons for tour scheduling, clarification requests, and human handoff
- **Tour Scheduling**: Automated tour time proposals with confirmation workflow
- **Human Handoff**: Seamless escalation to human agents when needed

## API Contract

The system implements a single REST endpoint:

**POST /api/reply**

**Request:**
```json
{
  "lead": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  },
  "message": "Hi, is a 2-bedroom still available and do you allow cats?",
  "preferences": {
    "bedrooms": 2,
    "move_in": "2025-07-01"
  },
  "community_id": "sunset-ridge"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "reply": "Hi Jane! Unit 12B is available and cats are welcome (one-time $50 fee). Tours are open this Saturday 10 am–2 pm—does 11 am work?",
  "action": "propose_tour",
  "proposed_time": "2025-06-14T18:00:00Z"
}
```

## Action Types

- **`propose_tour`**: System has enough info to suggest a specific tour slot
- **`ask_clarification`**: Lead's question is ambiguous or lacks key details  
- **`handoff_human`**: Request cannot be fulfilled automatically (e.g., no vacancies)

## Getting Started

For detailed setup instructions, testing guidelines, and development workflows, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

Quick start:
```bash
make setup  # Install dependencies
make dev    # Start both servers
```

## Testing Claude API Integration

The backend uses Claude API for intelligent agent responses. To test the integration:

### Prerequisites
1. Set your Claude API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Testing with curl
Test the agent integration directly:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/reply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lead": {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com"
    },
    "message": "Hi, is a 2-bedroom still available and do you allow cats?",
    "preferences": {
      "bedrooms": 2,
      "move_in": "2025-07-01"
    },
    "community_id": "sunset-ridge"
  }'
```

### Testing with Python
You can also test using Python:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/reply", json={
    "lead": {
        "name": "Jane Doe", 
        "email": "jane@example.com"
    },
    "message": "Hi, is a 2-bedroom still available and do you allow cats?",
    "preferences": {
        "bedrooms": 2,
        "move_in": "2025-07-01"
    },
    "community_id": "sunset-ridge"
})

print(response.json())
```

### Expected Response
The API should return a JSON response with:
- `reply`: Claude-generated response text
- `action`: One of "propose_tour", "ask_clarification", or "handoff_human"  
- `proposed_time`: ISO timestamp for tour proposals (if applicable)

### Test Results & Status

**✅ Integration Working**: The Claude API integration has been successfully tested and is functional.

**Verified Components:**
- ✅ Claude API connection with valid credentials
- ✅ MCP client successfully connects to domain tools
- ✅ Inventory data loading (3 communities, 8 total units)
- ✅ Tool execution: `check_availability`, `check_pet_policy`, `get_pricing`
- ✅ Agent service orchestration and request processing

**Sample Test Logs:**
```
2025-06-25 10:43:56,047 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-06-25 10:43:56,051 - tools.tools - INFO - LLM called check_availability: community_id=sunset-ridge, bedrooms=1
2025-06-25 10:43:56,051 - data.inventory - INFO - Found 1 available 1-bedroom units in sunset-ridge
2025-06-25 10:43:56,051 - app.services.mcp_client - INFO - MCP tool check_availability called successfully
```

**Known Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Message Formatting Issue**: There is a formatting issue in the final Claude API response causing `messages.2.content.0.type: Field required` error. The tools execute successfully but the final response formatting needs to be fixed in `claude_agent.py:227` where tool results are added to the conversation messages.

**Troubleshooting:**
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check that `CLAUDE_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **Credit Balance Error**: Add credits to your Claude API account
- **Connection Error**: Ensure backend server is running on port 8000

## MCP Implementation Notes

This project uses a **simplified MCP approach** rather than the full MCP protocol:

**Current Implementation (Direct Function Calls):**
- MCP tools are imported directly as Python functions
- All code runs in a single backend process
- Simpler deployment and debugging

**Full MCP Protocol Would Use:**
- Separate MCP server process communicating via JSON-RPC
- Process isolation between backend and tools
- Standard MCP protocol for cross-language compatibility

The current approach provides the **benefits of MCP** (standardized tool definitions, proper abstractions) without the **complexity of separate processes**. This is ideal for single-application deployments where simplicity and performance are prioritized over protocol standardization.

## Vector Similarity Search for Pet Policies

The system uses **FAISS vector similarity search** to intelligently match user pet queries to our predefined pet policy categories.

### The Problem
Users ask about pets using natural language that doesn't exactly match our data structure:
- User: "Can I have a **hamster**?" → Our data has: `"small_pets"`
- User: "Do you allow **puppies**?" → Our data has: `"dog"`
- User: "What about **bunnies**?" → Our data has: `"small_pets"`

### The Solution
**Vector Semantic Matching:**
1. **FAISS Index**: Build vector embeddings for all pet types (`dog`, `cat`, `bird`, `fish`, `small_pets`)
2. **Query Encoding**: Convert user queries ("hamster", "puppy") to vectors using `sentence-transformers`
3. **Similarity Search**: Find the closest matching pet type with confidence scores
4. **Intelligent Fallback**: Falls back to exact matching if vector search fails

### Example Matches
```
"hamster" → "small_pets" (confidence: 0.78)
"puppy" → "dog" (confidence: 0.85)
"kitten" → "cat" (confidence: 0.82)
"bunny" → "small_pets" (confidence: 0.76)
```

### Configuration
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.6 (configurable)
- **Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (fast, good quality)
- **Fallback**: Exact string matching if vector search fails
- **Caching**: Search results cached for performance

This enables natural conversation while maintaining accurate policy lookups.
